### Problem
Brushing is a task that we sometimes fail to do and most of the times don't do enough of. So, I wanted to devise a solution that would help people track the 
amount of time they brushed for and keep tabs about the stats on a dashboard that they can view and analyze at a later time.

### Solution
Testing to see if the brush has been taken out to brush using an ultrasonic distance sensor, I pushed the data to the SQL database using HTTP GET requests with PHP. 
Then, with the data, I provided an analysis dashboard to provide the users the tools with which they could determine how to improve their brushing patterns. Check
